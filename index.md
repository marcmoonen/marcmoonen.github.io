# Statement
@def id = "statement"

SPS appears to be thriving, e.g., with membership and journal/conference submission numbers showing consistent growth. Nevertheless, it has become clear that some of its critical structures and processes have become non-scalable, non-sustainable, or even malfunctioning. It is essential that these be redesigned, to support healthy further growth. This should be done with emphasis on service and quality, rather than profit and quantity, while demonstrating appreciation and respect for volunteers. 
 
### Journals and conferences
With journals offering similar target submission-to-publication times, conferences no longer offer the sole fast track to publication. Journals and conferences should therefore be jointly managed as one ecosystem, to fully exploit journal-conference synergies, and allow strategic positioning against the newer (but larger) ML/AI conferences. To guarantee consistent journal and conference publication policies, closer collaboration is needed between the Publications and Conferences Board. To guarantee continuity in policy implementation, structural assistance should be provided to conference organizing committees. For publications, open access should be kept affordable and more heavily supported. For conferences, hybrid/virtual formats should be further developed for those not able or willing to travel.
 
### Quality control
Quality control in publications cannot be compromised. However, recruiting qualified reviewers, especially in journals, has become problematic, leading to missed timeliness targets, burnout among editors, and dissatisfaction among authors. In addition to recent adjustments to editorial board structures and workflows, a systematic review commitment and performance monitoring should be implemented to safeguard review quality and editorial productivity, ideally also reducing the review load for the TCs.
 
### Services vs. service
Full support will be given to new initiatives aimed at enhancing member services, e.g., the educational program to offer curated educational content, and the establishment of the Industry Board to better serve industry members. Simultaneously, many more members should be encouraged to take on active volunteer roles, e.g., as reviewers, editors, TC members, mentors. More opportunities should be provided for early career volunteers, training activities should be expanded. To engage more members into sustained volunteer service, volunteer positions should require realistically budgeted time commitments and be sufficiently supported by staff.
 
### Ethics
IEEE ethical standards must be strictly enforced. In a globalized community with significant cultural differences, more ethics education should be provided, while strong ethical leadership should foster a culture of integrity and transparency. Journals and conferences are increasingly dealing with author/reviewer misconduct cases (ChatGPT!). To ensure consistency and efficiency, and offload editorial boards and conference committees, a society-level ethics committee should be established, as a gateway to IEEE-level support. 
 
### Finances
SPS is often perceived as a non-transparent business offering overly expensive services. SPS activities are primarily financed from publication revenue. This relies on a paywall model, which is increasingly at risk with the proliferation of free repositories, and furthermore will be significantly reduced by the transition to open access. Therefore, a more transparent and sustainable financial model should be adopted.
 
Addressing these and other challenges requires cooperation among leadership and volunteers. I firmly believe that my recent involvement in SPS has given me the experience and understanding to lead this endeavor.


# Biography
@def id = "biography"

Marc Moonen obtained his PhD degree from KU Leuven, Belgium, in 1990, and has been a Full Professor at KU Leuven, since 2004. Prior to this, he held postdoctoral, and assistant/associate professor positions at KU Leuven, was a PhD- and postdoctoral visiting researcher at the University of Stanford, University of Minnesota, and Delft University of Technology, and visiting professor at ALaRI, University of Lugano.

He was head of STADIUS Center for Dynamical Systems, Signal Processing, and Data Analytics for eight years (2013-2021), a KU Leuven research division with 10+ professors and 150+ PhD- and postdoctoral researchers.

His research is in the field of numerical algorithms and signal processing for digital communications, digital audio- and speech processing. He has supervised/co-supervised 60 defended PhD-theses, authored/co-authored 300+ journal papers (175+ in IEEE journals) and 400+ international conference papers (150+ in IEEE conferences). 

His research has consistently had a strong industry focus, e.g., with over twenty years of ongoing cooperation in the area of digital subscriber lines with Nokia Bell Labs (formerly Alcatel-Bell/Alcatel-Lucent) and in the area of hearing instruments and cochlear implants with Cochlear Ltd. He is also a co-founder of conneXounds (www.connexounds.com), a company developing BYOD audio technology for hybrid meeting environments.

He is an IEEE Fellow (2007) and a Fellow of EURASIP (2018). He received a EURASIP Meritorious Service Award (2020), and was co-recipient of the CELTIC Excellence Award (for EU/CELTIC Project ‘BANITS’, 2008) and 10 journals/conference best paper awards.

### IEEE service 
He served as SPS Vice President-Publications (2021-2023). Together with the Publications Board, he reorganized the workflow and editorial board structure to improve timeliness and strengthen quality control in the largest SPS journals, modified and automated the nomination/self-nomination process for editorial board members and adjusted policy to allow longer SAE/AE terms, initiated the OJSP short paper submission track for ICASSP/ICIP with editorial board sharing across journals, streamlined requirements for journal paper presentations in conferences, initiated paper cascading ideas, and revised several policies and procedures to improve overall efficiency. 

He also served as member-at-large of the SPS Board of Governors, as member of the SPS Awards Board, the SPS Fellow Reference Committee, the SPS Nominations and Appointments Committee, the SPS Technical Committee on Signal Processing for Communications, the ICASSP-2008 Organizing Committee, and as Chair of the SPS Benelux Chapter. He was a member of the editorial board of the Transactions on Circuits and Systems-II, the Signal Processing Magazine, and area editor for ‘Feature Articles’ for the Signal Processing Magazine. 

### EURASIP service
He was President of EURASIP (European Association for Signal Processing) for four years (2007-2008, 2011-2012). He served on the EURASIP Board of Directors for altogether sixteen years, also as Treasurer/Secretary and as Director for Publications. He served as Chair of the EURASIP Fellow Selection Committee, and as member of the EUSIPCO-2010 and EUSIPCO-2015 Organizing Committee. He was Editor-in-Chief for the EURASIP Journal on Advances in Signal Processing, and was a member of the editorial board of the EURASIP Journal on Advances in Signal Processing, the EURASIP Journal on Wireless Communications and Networking, and Elsevier Signal Processing.
