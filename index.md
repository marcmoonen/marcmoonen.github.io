# Election Statement  <a id="election_statement" href="#top" style="font-size: .75em; float: right; color: #0642bb; text-align: center; border-bottom: 2px solid #5ea4ee;">Back to top</a>

In many ways, the SPS is doing well. Membership is steadily increasing. Journals and conferences are highly reputed, with steadily increasing submission numbers. A new educational program has been launched to offer curated educational content. A new Industry Board has been installed to better serve our members from industry. 
 
Nevertheless, consolidating our favorable position may prove challenging, because some of our structures and processes are non-scalable, non-sustainable, even malfunctioning. Therefore, our first goal should not be to merely pursue further growth in numbers, e.g., membership and submissions, but to future-proof the society by redesigning these structures and processes. Major challenges are then as follows:
 
**Journals and conferences:** 
Journals and conferences should become one jointly managed ecosystem, allowing journal-conference synergies to be exploited, e.g., to optimally (re)use review resources, and eliminate conference precursors by promoting journal paper presentation in the conferences. To guarantee consistency across journal and conference publication policies, the Publications Board should have ‘conference representatives’, who also assist and bring continuity across successive conference organizing committees. Open access publication, as advocated by our funding agencies, should be supported and promoted more heavily. Post-covid hybrid/virtual conference formats should be further developed for those not able (e.g., for financial reasons) or not willing (e.g., for ecological reasons) to travel. 
 
**Peer-review crisis**
Recruiting qualified reviewers, especially in journals, has become extremely difficult, leading to compromised quality control and timeliness, burnout among editors, and dissatisfaction among authors. Editorial board structures and workflows to improve efficiency and quality control have recently been adjusted, but more is needed. A system with registered (and committed) reviewers and performance monitoring should be created, to improve review quality and keep editorial work workable. 
 
**Member services vs. volunteer service**
Member services and benefits will be expanded where possible. However, many more members should be encouraged to step up from merely service consumers to active volunteers, e.g. reviewers, editors, TC members, mentors. For this, our training activities should be expanded into full professional development programs. To engage more members into sustained volunteer service, e.g., editor and (D)EiC positions should come with a realistically budgeted and affordable time commitment and be efficiently supported by staff.
 
**Ethics**
IEEE ethics standards must be strictly enforced, especially so in a globalized community with strong cultural differences. Journals and conferences, for instance, are increasingly dealing with author/reviewer misconduct cases (GenAI accelerated), where individual case investigations are time-consuming and consistency is not guaranteed. Therefore, a more efficient and agile society-level ethics committee should be installed. 
 
**Finances**
SPS revenue is primarily publication revenue, hence many SPS activities financially depend on publication revenue. However, publication revenue relies on a paywall model, which is increasingly at risk with the proliferation of free public repositories. Furthermore, it will be significantly reduced by the (long-overdue) transition to open access. A future-proof sustainable financial model is called for.
 
Addressing these (and other) challenges will require creativity and cooperation among leadership and volunteers, in an open culture of debate, collegiality, diversity and inclusion. Being selected to lead this endeavor would be a privilege.

<!-- ---------------------
**Growing Technical Opportunities** – Machine learning, algorithms, and software offer vast opportunities in areas ranging from speech to imaging and from practice to theory. We need to provide ever more accessible and affordable technical forums and services to our stakeholders in these rapidly developing areas.

**Transition to Open Access** – The Society must move rapidly toward OA publication models that are both affordable and sustainable. We will need to develop more OA publication venues while simultaneously developing new business models that leverage the community and third-party investment.

**Next Generation Conferences** – The pandemic created a unique opportunity to reimagine the concept of conferences. When done well with enhanced social interaction, hybrid and online conferences offer the potential to reduce costs and provide greater access for geographically and technically diverse communities to discuss important topics in depth. I would lead the society to create targeted satellite meetings, to exploit the synergy between conferences and journals, and to expand educational, tutorial, and open-source software development activities.

**Increasing Society Diversity** – For a successful future, our society must proactively build diversity by reaching out to under-represented communities and partnering with representative organizations to create a pipeline of future talent. We need to demonstrate and communicate that signal processing can be a fun and rewarding career path for young people around the world with all backgrounds and experiences!

**Technology Policy** – Signal processing technologies play an increasingly important role in the world at large.  The SP Society must engage with the resulting issues by helping to set priorities for technology investment both within and outside the society.  I would seek to engage with a wide range of government and non-government organizations to enhance the future of the signal processing community.

Based on this, I ask for your vote for President Elect of the IEEE Signal Processing Society! -->

His research is in the field of numerical algorithms and signal processing for digital communications, digital audio- and speech processing. He has supervised/co-supervised 58 defended PhD-theses. He has authored/co-authored 300+ journal papers (175+ in IEEE journals) and 400+ international conference papers (150+ in IEEE conferences). His research has consistently had a strong industry focus, e.g. with over twenty years of ongoing cooperation in the area of DSL with Nokia (formerly Alcatel-Bell/Alcatel-Lucent) and in the area of hearing instruments and cochlear implants with Cochlear Ltd. He is also a co-founder of conneXounds (www.connexounds.com), a company developing BYOD audio technology for hybrid meeting environments.

He is an IEEE Fellow (2007) and a Fellow of EURASIP (European Association for Signal Processing, 2018). He received the EURASIP Meritorious Service Award (2020). He was co-recipient of the CELTIC Excellence Award (for EU/CELTIC Project ‘BANITS’, 2008), and 10 journals/conference best paper awards.
