# Election Statement
@def id = "election_statement"

SPS appears to be thriving, e.g., with membership and journal/conference submission numbers showing consistent growth. Nevertheless, it has become evident that some of its critical structures and processes are no longer scalable, sustainable, even malfunctioning. It is essential that these be redesigned, to support healthy further growth. This should be done with emphasis on service and quality, rather than profit and quantity, while demonstrating appreciation and respect for volunteers. 
 
**Journals and conferences** <br>
With journals offering similar target submission-to-publication times, conferences no longer offer the sole fast track to publication. Journals and conferences should therefore be jointly managed as one ecosystem, to fully exploit journal-conference synergies, and allow strategic positioning against the newer (but larger) ML/AI conferences. To guarantee consistent journal and conference publication policies, closer collaboration is needed between the Publications- and Conferences Board. To guarantee continuity in policy implementation, structural assistance should be provided to conference organizing committees. For publications, open access should be kept affordable and more heavily supported. For conferences, hybrid/virtual formats should be further developed for those not able or willing to travel.
 
**Quality control** <br>
Quality control in publications cannot be compromised. However, recruiting qualified reviewers, especially in journals, has become problematic, leading to missed timeliness targets, burnout among editors, and dissatisfaction among authors. In addition to recent adjustments to editorial board structures and workflows, a systematic review commitment and performance monitoring should be implemented to safeguard review quality and editorial productivity, ideally also reducing the review load for the TCs.
 
**Services vs. service** <br>
Full support will be given to new initiatives aimed at enhancing member services, e.g., the educational program to offer curated educational content, and the establishment of the Industry Board to better serve industry members. Simultaneously, many more members should be encouraged to take on active volunteer roles, e.g., as reviewers, editors, TC members, mentors. More opportunities should be provided for early career volunteers, training activities should be expanded. To engage more members into sustained volunteer service, volunteer positions should require realistically budgeted time commitments and be sufficiently supported by staff.
 
**Ethics** <br>
IEEE ethical standards must be strictly enforced. In a globalized community with significant cultural differences, more ethics education should be provided, while strong ethical leadership should foster a culture of integrity and transparency. Journals and conferences are increasingly dealing with author/reviewer misconduct cases (ChatGPT!). To ensure consistency and efficiency, and offload editorial boards and conference committees, a society-level ethics committee should be established, as a gateway to IEEE-level support. 
 
**Finances** <br>
SPS is often perceived as a non-transparent business offering overly expensive services. SPS activities are primarily financed from publication revenue. This relies on a paywall model, which is increasingly at risk with the proliferation of free repositories, and furthermore will be significantly reduced by the transition to open access. Therefore, a more transparent and sustainable financial model should be adopted.
 
Addressing these and other challenges requires cooperation among leadership and volunteers. I firmly believe that my recent involvement in SPS has given me the experience and understanding to lead this endeavor.

<!-- ---------------------
**Growing Technical Opportunities** – Machine learning, algorithms, and software offer vast opportunities in areas ranging from speech to imaging and from practice to theory. We need to provide ever more accessible and affordable technical forums and services to our stakeholders in these rapidly developing areas.

**Transition to Open Access** – The Society must move rapidly toward OA publication models that are both affordable and sustainable. We will need to develop more OA publication venues while simultaneously developing new business models that leverage the community and third-party investment.

**Next Generation Conferences** – The pandemic created a unique opportunity to reimagine the concept of conferences. When done well with enhanced social interaction, hybrid and online conferences offer the potential to reduce costs and provide greater access for geographically and technically diverse communities to discuss important topics in depth. I would lead the society to create targeted satellite meetings, to exploit the synergy between conferences and journals, and to expand educational, tutorial, and open-source software development activities.

**Increasing Society Diversity** – For a successful future, our society must proactively build diversity by reaching out to under-represented communities and partnering with representative organizations to create a pipeline of future talent. We need to demonstrate and communicate that signal processing can be a fun and rewarding career path for young people around the world with all backgrounds and experiences!

**Technology Policy** – Signal processing technologies play an increasingly important role in the world at large.  The SP Society must engage with the resulting issues by helping to set priorities for technology investment both within and outside the society.  I would seek to engage with a wide range of government and non-government organizations to enhance the future of the signal processing community.

Based on this, I ask for your vote for President Elect of the IEEE Signal Processing Society! -->
