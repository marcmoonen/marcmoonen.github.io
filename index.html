Nevertheless, it has become clear that some of its critical structures and processes have become non-scalable, non-sustainable, or even malfunctioning. It is essential that these be redesigned first to support healthy further growth. This should be done with emphasis on service and quality, rather than profit and quantity, while demonstrating appreciation and respect for volunteers. Major challenges are as follows:</p> <h3 id=journals_and_conferences ><a href="#journals_and_conferences" class=header-anchor >Journals and conferences</a></h3> <p>With journals offering similar target submission-to-publication times, conferences no longer offer the sole fast track to publication. Journals and conferences should therefore be jointly managed as one ecosystem, to fully exploit journal-conference synergies, e.g., to optimally &#40;re&#41;use review resources, and to allow strategic positioning against the newer &#40;but larger&#41; ML/AI conferences. To guarantee consistent journal and conference publication policies, closer collaboration is needed between the Publications and Conferences Board. To guarantee continuity in policy implementation, structural assistance should be provided to conference organizing committees. For publications, open access should be kept affordable and more heavily supported. For conferences, hybrid/virtual formats should be further developed for those not able to travel &#40;e.g., for financial reasons&#41; or not willing to travel &#40;e.g., for ecological reasons&#41;.</p> <h3 id=quality_control ><a href="#quality_control" class=header-anchor >Quality control</a></h3> <p>Quality control in publications cannot be compromised. However, recruiting qualified reviewers, especially in journals, has become problematic, leading to missed timeliness targets, burnout among editors, and dissatisfaction among authors. In addition to recent adjustments to editorial board structures and workflows, a systematic review commitment and performance monitoring should be implemented to safeguard review quality and editorial productivity, ideally also reducing the review load for the TCs.</p> <h3 id=services_vs_service ><a href="#services_vs_service" class=header-anchor >Services vs. service</a></h3> <p>Full support will be given to new initiatives aimed at enhancing member services, e.g., the new educational program to offer curated educational content, and the establishment of the Industry Board to better serve industry members. Simultaneously, many more members should be encouraged to take on active volunteer roles, e.g., as reviewers, editors, TC members, mentors. More opportunities should be provided for early career volunteers, training activities should be expanded. To engage more members into sustained volunteer service, volunteer positions should require realistically budgeted time commitments and be sufficiently supported by staff.</p> <h3 id=ethics ><a href="#ethics" class=header-anchor >Ethics</a></h3> <p>IEEE ethical standards must be strictly enforced. In a globalized community with significant cultural differences, more ethics education should be provided, while strong ethical leadership should foster a culture of integrity and transparency. Journals and conferences are increasingly dealing with author/reviewer misconduct cases &#40;ChatGPT&#33;&#41;. To ensure consistency and efficiency, and offload editorial boards and conference committees, a society-level ethics committee should be established as a gateway to IEEE-level support. </p> <h3 id=finances ><a href="#finances" class=header-anchor >Finances</a></h3> <p>SPS is often perceived as a non-transparent business offering overly expensive services. SPS activities are primarily financed from publication revenue. This relies on a paywall model, which is increasingly at risk with the proliferation of free repositories, and in all likelihood will be significantly reduced by the transition to open access. Therefore, a more transparent and sustainable financial model should be adopted.</p> <p>Addressing these and other challenges requires cooperation among leadership and volunteers. I firmly believe that my recent involvement in SPS has given me the experience and understanding to lead this endeavor.<br /> <br /></p> <h1 id=why_vote_for_me ><a href="#why_vote_for_me" class=header-anchor >Why vote for me?</a></h1> <h3 id=sps_leadership_experience ><a href="#sps_leadership_experience" class=header-anchor >SPS leadership experience</a></h3> <p>I served as SPS Vice President-Publications &#40;2021-2023&#41; and as member-at-large of the SPS Board of Governors &#40;2020&#41;. As SPS Vice President-Publications I have sought to move beyond business as usual and drive meaningful, lasting change. Together with the Publications Board, I reorganized the workflow and editorial board structure in the largest SPS journals to improve timeliness and strengthen quality control, modified and automated the nomination/self-nomination process for editorial board members, adjusted policy to allow longer SAE/AE terms wherever relevant, initiated the OJSP short paper submission track for ICASSP/ICIP with editorial board sharing across journals, streamlined requirements for journal paper presentations in conferences, initiated paper cascading ideas, and revised several policies and procedures to improve overall efficiency.</p> <h3 id=other_leadership_experience ><a href="#other_leadership_experience" class=header-anchor >Other leadership experience </a></h3> <p>I served as President of EURASIP &#40;European Association for Signal Processing&#41; for four years &#40;first term 2007-2008, second term 2011-2012&#41;. I served on the EURASIP Board of Directors for sixteen years &#40;1999-2014&#41;, including terms as Treasurer/Secretary and as Director of Publications. I coordinated the formal registration of EURASIP as a non-profit organization &#40;under Belgian law&#41; and drafted its inaugural Bylaws &#40;2006&#41;. As Director of Publications &#40;2005-2006&#41;, I drove the transition of selected EURASIP journals to Open Access and oversaw the launch of new Open Access journals.<br />For eight years &#40;first term 2013-2017, second term 2017-2021&#41;, I was Head of Division of STADIUS Center for Dynamical Systems, Signal Processing, and Data Analytics, a KU Leuven research division with 10&#43; professors and over 150 PhD and postdoctoral researchers.</p> <h3 id=academic_record ><a href="#academic_record" class=header-anchor >Academic record </a></h3> <p>I have been a Full Professor at KU Leuven, Belgium, since 2004. I obtained a PhD degree from KU Leuven in 1990, and have been a PhD and postdoctoral visiting researcher at the University of Stanford, University of Minnesota, and Delft University of Technology, and a visiting professor at ALaRI, University of Lugano. I am a Fellow of the IEEE &#40;2007&#41;, Fellow of EURASIP &#40;2018&#41;, recipient of the EURASIP Meritorious Service Award &#40;2020&#41; and the IEEE SPS Claude Shannon-Harry Nyquist Technical Achievement Award &#40;2024&#41;, and co-recipient of the EU/CELTIC Excellence Award &#40;for EU/CELTIC Project ‘BANITS’, 2008&#41;, as well as 10 journal/conference best paper awards.<br />For over 25 years I headed a team of 15&#43; PhD and postdoctoral researchers in the field of numerical algorithms and signal processing for digital communications, digital audio- and speech processing. I have supervised/co-supervised 60 defended PhD-theses, authored/co-authored 300&#43; journal papers &#40;of which 175&#43; in IEEE journals&#41; and 400&#43; international conference papers &#40;of which 150&#43; in IEEE conferences&#41;. <br /><a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user&#61;OX95yYsAAAAJ">Google Scholar Link</a><br /><a href="https://www.mathgenealogy.org/id.php?id&#61;97319">MathGenealogy Link</a></p> <h3 id=industry_and_entrepreneurship_experience ><a href="#industry_and_entrepreneurship_experience" class=header-anchor >Industry and entrepreneurship experience</a></h3> <p>My research has consistently had a strong industry focus, e.g., with over twenty years of ongoing cooperation in the area of digital subscriber lines &#40;DSL&#41; with Nokia Bell Labs &#40;formerly Alcatel-Bell/Alcatel-Lucent&#41; and in the area of hearing instruments and cochlear implants with Cochlear Ltd, which has resulted in 10&#43; patents/patent applications as well as several &#40;DSL&#41; standardization contributions.<br />I am a co-founder of conneXounds, a company developing BYOD audio technology for hybrid meeting environments.<br /><a href="https://www.bell-labs.com/institute/blog/ku-leuven-professor-reflects-20-years-collaboration-bell-labs/">Nokia Bell Labs Link</a><br /><a href="https://www.connexounds.com">conneXounds Link</a></p> <h3 id=volunteer_service ><a href="#volunteer_service" class=header-anchor >Volunteer service</a></h3> <p>I held the role of Chair of the EURASIP Fellow Selection Committee &#40;2018-2021&#41; and Chair of the SPS Benelux Chapter &#40;1998-2002&#41;. I was a member of the SPS Awards Board &#40;2008-2010&#41;, the SPS Fellow Reference Committee &#40;2014-2016&#41;, the SPS Nominations and Appointments Committee &#40;2024&#41;, and the SPS Technical Committee on Signal Processing for Communications &#40;first term 2005-2007, second term 2008-2010&#41;. I was a member of the ICASSP-2008 Organizing Committee, the EUSIPCO-2010 Organizing Committee &#40;Tutorials Chair&#41;, and the EUSIPCO-2015 Organizing Committee &#40;Awards Chair&#41;.<br />My editorial leadership roles include Editor-in-Chief for the EURASIP Journal on Advances in Signal Processing &#40;2003-2005&#41; and area editor for ‘Feature Articles’ for the IEEE Signal Processing Magazine &#40;2012-2014&#41;.

A frequently asked question is whether &#40;and when&#41; SPS should further transition to Open Access. Open Access certainly remains a highly desirable publication model for several reasons, but transitioning all SPS journals to Open Access will also have significant implications:<br />The Open Access &#40;‘author pays’&#41; model has been promoted for over two decades, as a reaction to rising journal subscription fees, outpacing academic institutions&#39; library budgets. Open Access has also been promoted by funding agencies stating that the results of publicly funded &#40;academic&#41; research should not be locked behind a paywall. Finally, Open Access provides full financial transparency, in that the total per-published-paper revenue for the publisher is the Article Processing Charge &#40;APC&#41; paid by the author, nothing more nothing less.<br />In the traditional Toll Access &#40;‘reader pays’&#41; publication model, such financial transparency is lacking, e.g., IEEE Xplore institutional subscription fees are not publicly advertised. However, the average per-published-paper revenue under this Toll Access publication model significantly exceeds the current Open Access APC, namely by a factor of more than two. A persistent misconception is that Open Access is financially more profitable than Toll Access, but so it is not, in fact it is the other way around.<br />While commercial publishers have been &#40;successfully&#41; delaying the transition to Open Access to maximize shareholder profit, e.g., by adopting the Hybrid &#40;a.k.a. ‘double dipping’&#41; model, IEEE has followed similar strategies to preserve critical revenue that funds much of its operation. And so this also holds for SPS: While flipping its journals to Open Access -and doing so without increasing the APC- is desirable &#40;and is long overdue&#41;, it will have a significant financial impact, necessitating a critical analysis of its current cost structure. </p> <div class=page-foot > <div class=copyright > &copy; Marc Moonen.
