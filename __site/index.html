<p>In many ways, the SPS is doing well. Membership is steadily increasing. Journals and conferences are highly reputed, with steadily increasing submission numbers. A new educational program has been launched to offer curated educational content. A new Industry Board has been installed to better serve our members from industry. </p>
<p>Nevertheless, consolidating our favorable position may prove challenging, because some of our structures and processes are non-scalable, non-sustainable, even malfunctioning. Therefore, our first goal should not be to merely pursue further growth in numbers, e.g., membership and submissions, but to future-proof the society by redesigning these structures and processes. Major challenges are then as follows:</p>
<p><strong>Journals and conferences:</strong>  Journals and conferences should become one jointly managed ecosystem, allowing journal-conference synergies to be exploited, e.g., to optimally &#40;re&#41;use review resources, and eliminate conference precursors by promoting journal paper presentation in the conferences. To guarantee consistency across journal and conference publication policies, the Publications Board should have ‘conference representatives’, who also assist and bring continuity across successive conference organizing committees. Open access publication, as advocated by our funding agencies, should be supported and promoted more heavily. Post-covid hybrid/virtual conference formats should be further developed for those not able &#40;e.g., for financial reasons&#41; or not willing &#40;e.g., for ecological reasons&#41; to travel. </p>
<p><strong>Peer-review crisis</strong> Recruiting qualified reviewers, especially in journals, has become extremely difficult, leading to compromised quality control and timeliness, burnout among editors, and dissatisfaction among authors. Editorial board structures and workflows to improve efficiency and quality control have recently been adjusted, but more is needed. A system with registered &#40;and committed&#41; reviewers and performance monitoring should be created, to improve review quality and keep editorial work workable. </p>
<p><strong>Member services vs. volunteer service</strong> Member services and benefits will be expanded where possible. However, many more members should be encouraged to step up from merely service consumers to active volunteers, e.g. reviewers, editors, TC members, mentors. For this, our training activities should be expanded into full professional development programs. To engage more members into sustained volunteer service, e.g., editor and &#40;D&#41;EiC positions should come with a realistically budgeted and affordable time commitment and be efficiently supported by staff.</p>
<p><strong>Ethics</strong> IEEE ethics standards must be strictly enforced, especially so in a globalized community with strong cultural differences. Journals and conferences, for instance, are increasingly dealing with author/reviewer misconduct cases &#40;GenAI accelerated&#41;, where individual case investigations are time-consuming and consistency is not guaranteed. Therefore, a more efficient and agile society-level ethics committee should be installed. </p>
<p><strong>Finances</strong> SPS revenue is primarily publication revenue, hence many SPS activities financially depend on publication revenue. However, publication revenue relies on a paywall model, which is increasingly at risk with the proliferation of free public repositories. Furthermore, it will be significantly reduced by the &#40;long-overdue&#41; transition to open access. A future-proof sustainable financial model is called for.</p>
<p>Addressing these &#40;and other&#41; challenges will require creativity and cooperation among leadership and volunteers, in an open culture of debate, collegiality, diversity and inclusion. Being selected to lead this endeavor would be a privilege.</p>
